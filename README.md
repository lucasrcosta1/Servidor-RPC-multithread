# Servidor-RPC Multithreaded
Tested in Ubuntu 16

Steps to reproduce it:

1) Clone the repository;
2) Open a terminal window in the project directory
3) Run command 'make'
4) Run './serverOP'
5) Open another terminal window and run './clientOp <ip_addr>'

You can run step 5 as many times as you'd wish as long as the server is up.
